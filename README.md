# This is a game

Made in Godot yay

## A game made on a globalgame jam

We only participated the last 48 hours of it, to make it funnier (help)

### In La Plata

Aguante la plata vieja

#### The game name is in Spanish. It's called: Las desopilantes aventuras del pequeño y ruidoso hamster, el Señor Mofletes, que un tórrido viernes de enero a eso de las 3PM irritó sobremanera a un poderoso y barbudo archimago que lo maldijo por toda la eternidad y lo condenó a recorrer niveles sospechosamente similares bajo el agua dentro de un videojuego de la Global Game Jam 2025
(or LDADPYRH,ESM,QUTVDEAEDL3PISAUPYBAQLMPTLEYLCARNSSBEADDUVDLGGJ2025 for short)

This game was made using eXtreme Go Horse methodology (XGH): more [info here](https://medium.com/@dekaah/22-axioms-of-the-extreme-go-horse-methodology-xgh-9fa739ab55b4)

So, don't judge the devs, ignore the despicables horrors of bad design practices. For every line of code that looks bad, think that we were just following XGH.

We had lots of fun doing this game, so I hope that if you read this, you have fun playing it, or at least that you had fun reading this.

That being said, shotout to [Miki](https://github.com/nagykorte) <3 it was a pleassure suffer the consecuences of our own actions (having studied programming) with you.
